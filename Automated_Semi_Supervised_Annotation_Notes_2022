Many layers to this (conversation ai life cycle -small image)

But ost prominent one of focus right now is the topic modeling and performance autimentaiton scheme

I’ll note that life cycle phase here and where we’re looking to implement more strategy and collaboration about NLU experts and data scientist with PNC order to make EVA PNC a lot smarter in a short amount of time. Team work makes the dream work!

Work smart and not hard. Implement what you already had first.

Thanks for previous exchanges via slack ___and ___ here is the updated mural link. As we discussed Dustin will reach out to initiate ideation on collaboration for human expert annotation sourcing (i.e, customer service/chat agent experts). From there Wie will ideas on upcoming phases such as a PNC specific autolabling algorithm (i.e., Naive Bayes, then Bert implementation) and in the near future a way of encapsulation chatbot model performance within this specific organization in order to avoid inter-organizational high semantic similarity conflicts. I hope that makes sense. I look forward to meting with you all soon.

___ I will be using your tip to collect annoyed dat via the Doccano IDE on ANA_16. As mentioned before if you all have any text based  previously labeled samples then please feel free to share via box. I should be sharing a link to the Curren tPNC samples promptly listed on ANA_16.
